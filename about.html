	<h1>about</h1>

	<p>I'm Diana Zhang and welcome to my awesome food blog. Every so often, I try creating new
        recipies and post it here to share it with you guys. If you enjoy any of
        my recipies, feel free to leave a comment.</p>

	<p>I grew up in California and I currently am an undergrad at Princeton University. Ever since I was a
        kid, I have always loved cooking. I saw it as both a science and an art. I love watching people's
        faces light up whenever they try what I make.</p>

    <p>I created this blog to be relatable. You can ask anyone who knows me, I am a humongous clutz. My recipies are not about making something pretty, rather, they're to make something absolutely and positively delicious! If I can pull through, so can you! </p>
